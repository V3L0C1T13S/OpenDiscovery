# Open Discovery

FOSS implementation of Revolts discovery backend.

Revolt discovery, otherwise known as rvlt.gg, is Revolt's official closed source server, bot, and theme listing.

## Project goals

Implement the backend code of rvlt.gg/Revolt discovery

Self-hostable

Compatibility with the official discovery

Easy to manage

## Out of scope

This is a FOSS reimplementation of the backend. The official frontend will **not** be used.

You can use the official frontend/client with a modified endpoint, but keep in mind that we will only accept issues regarding the backend, not the frontend.

Activity types (ex. High activity, medium, etc.) will not be done in this project simply because it is technically impossible without direct database access.
A bot is planned in the future that will reimplement this functionality, but it is impossible at the moment.
